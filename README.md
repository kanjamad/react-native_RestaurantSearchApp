* Inside there are users going to search for some kind of restaurant.

* Each of these are going to be different categories of restaurants that find.
* First present some cheap options so inexpensive restaurants then a little bit pricier.
* And then some expensive restaurants down at the bottom.
* Each of these different sections are going to scroll horizontally.
* So going to allow the user to scroll left to right to see a list of cheap restaurants and then moderate and then expensive once the user taps on a given restaurant were then going to take them to a detail page where it will show them a couple of images from that restaurant on the screen in a kind of list that they can scroll through very easily when a user is on this detail screen.
